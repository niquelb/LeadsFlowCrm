To use LeadsFlowCRM, you must first grant permission to access your Gmail account through the Gmail API. Once you have granted permission, you can create pipelines and start organizing your leads.

To create a new pipeline, click on the "Add Pipeline" button and give your pipeline a name. You can chose a preset for your pipeline or create one from scratch. You can then add stages to your pipeline, such as "Pending", "Contacted", "Negotiating", and so on. To add leads to your pipeline, simply click on the "Add Lead" button and fill in the relevant information. You can then assign the lead to a specific stage within the pipeline.

To view your pipelines and leads, navigate to the "Pipelines" page and select the appropiate pipeline. Here, you can see all of the stages of the pipeline in a horizontal, Kanban-style board. You can drag and drop leads between stages to update their progress.
